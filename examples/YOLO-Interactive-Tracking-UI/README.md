# Ultralytics YOLO Interactive Tracking UI üéØ

A modular, educational real-time object detection and tracking UI built with [Ultralytics YOLOv8](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics) and OpenCV.

This project is ideal for:

- Learning how to integrate [YOLO](https://docs.ultralytics.com) with [object tracking](https://docs.ultralytics.com/modes/track/)
- Testing on edge devices (e.g., Raspberry Pi, Jetson Nano)
- Real-time demos with interactive user input
- Enhancing CV pipelines with tracking UI/UX overlays

## Project Demo

## Features

- Real-time object detection and visual tracking
- Click on any object to initiate tracking
- Scope lines and bold bounding box for active tracking
- Dashed boxes for passive (non-tracked) objects
- Live terminal updates with object ID, label, confidence, center
- Configurable thresholds and tracker engine (e.g. `bytetrack`, `botsort`)
- Supports:
  - PyTorch `.pt` models for GPU (Jetson, desktop with CUDA)
  - NCNN `.param + .bin` models for CPU-only (Raspberry Pi, ARM)

## Hardware & Model Compatibility

| Platform         | Model Format       | Example Model        | GPU Acceleration | Notes                           |
| ---------------- | ------------------ | -------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Raspberry Pi 4/5 | NCNN (.param/.bin) | `yolov8n_ncnn_model` | ‚ùå CPU only      | Recommended format for Pi/ARM   |
| Jetson Nano      | PyTorch (.pt)      | `yolov8n.pt`         | ‚úÖ CUDA          | Real-time performance possible  |
| Desktop w/ GPU   | PyTorch (.pt)      | `yolov8s.pt`         | ‚úÖ CUDA          | Best performance                |
| CPU-only laptops | NCNN (.param/.bin) | `yolov8n_ncnn_model` | ‚ùå               | Decent performance (~10‚Äì15 FPS) |

## Installation

### Basic Dependencies

```bash
pip install ultralytics opencv-python
```

> Use a virtual environment like `venv` or `conda` (recommended).

---

### Optional: Enable GPU (for PyTorch models)

Install PyTorch based on your system and CUDA version:  
üëâ https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/

---

## Quick Start

### Step 1: Download, Convert, or Specify Your Model

- **Official YOLO Models:**  
  For official YOLO models (e.g., `yolov11s.pt` or `yolov8s.pt`), simply specify the model name as `MODEL_PATH_CPU` or `MODEL_PATH_GPU`. These models will be auto-downloaded and cached, or you can manually download them from [Ultralytics Assets Releases](https://github.com/ultralytics/assets/releases) and place them in the folder.
  
- **Custom YOLO Models:**  
  If you're using a custom YOLO model, ensure the model file is in the project folder or provide its relative path in the parameters.

- **Supported Formats:**
  - `yolov8n.pt` (for GPU with PyTorch)
  - `yolov8n_ncnn_model` (for CPU with NCNN)

---

### Step 2: Configure the Script

Edit the top global paramters of `interactive_tracker.py`:

```python
USE_GPU = False  # Set to True for running on GPU

# For official models, simply specify the model name:
MODEL_PATH_GPU = "yolov11s.pt"  # Model that will be run if USE_GPU = True
MODEL_PATH_CPU = "yolov11s.pt"  # or "yolov11s_ncnn_model", Model that will be run if USE_GPU = False


SHOW_FPS = True                   # If True, shows current FPS in top-left corner

CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD = 0.3        # Min confidence for object detection (lower = more detections, possibly more false positives)
IOU_THRESHOLD = 0.3               # IoU threshold for NMS (higher = less overlap allowed)
MAX_DETECTION = 20                # Maximum objects per frame (increase for crowded scenes)

TRACKER_TYPE = "bytetrack.yaml"   # Tracker config: 'bytetrack.yaml', 'botsort.yaml', etc.

```

---

### Step 3: Run the object tracking

```bash
python interactive_tracker.py
```

---

### Controls

- üñ±Ô∏è Left-click ‚Üí Select an object to track
- üîÑ Press `c` ‚Üí Cancel/reset tracking
- ‚ùå Press `q` ‚Üí Quit the app
